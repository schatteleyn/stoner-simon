This aussie stoner/doom band got some groovy riffs, and the best lyrics EVER !  

Come with me  
Ten thousand leagues   
Under the T.H.Sea   

Fuck your swim coach   
And fucking choke   
On this gnarly roach   

Snags and swimming trunks   
Don't come unless   
You're high or fucking drunk   

Don't forget your towel

Bad play on word and H2G2 references ? Yes sir !  
Also, check out their cover of the [Game Of Thrones theme !](http://lizzardwizzard.bandcamp.com/track/game-of-cones)
